# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

A beginner-friendly machine learning project where I explore data from the Titanic disaster to predict whether a passenger survived or not using classification techniques.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is based on the famous [Titanic dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data). The goal is to predict passenger survival based on features like age, sex, class, and family relationships.

## 🔍 Key Steps

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (handling missing values, feature selection)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
- Encoding categorical variables
- Training a machine learning model (coming soon)
- Making predictions and evaluating performance

## 📊 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Scikit-learn (ML models, coming soon)

## 📁 Project Structure

## 📈 Results (So Far)

- Found significant survival differences based on **Sex**, **Pclass**, and **Age**
- Filled missing `Age` values with median
- Dropped columns with excessive missing values (like `Cabin`)

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Train ML models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.
- Use cross-validation and confusion matrix for evaluation
- Try hyperparameter tuning
